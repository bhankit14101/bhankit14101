# 👋 Hi, I'm Ankit Bhardwaj  
### Senior Data Engineer → Emerging LLM Platform Engineer

I design and build large-scale data systems across **AWS**, **GCP**, and **Azure**, and I’m now focused on engineering intelligent **local LLM platforms** — systems that run multiple models locally, route tasks dynamically, integrate external tools, and behave like a truly “smart” terminal.

## 📌 Highlights
- Reduced recommendation latency by **30%** with optimized GCP pipelines  
- Improved fraud-detection accuracy by **40%** via real-time ingestion + ML automation  
- Cut Spark compute costs by **20%** using Datadog-driven FinOps  
- Built a cloud-agnostic Spark-on-Kubernetes platform  
- Led GDPR-compliant Data Mesh migration with full cataloging and governance

## 🔥 Current Focus  
Building a **smart local LLM terminal** capable of intelligent task routing, model orchestration, and tool-invocation.  
Skills involved in this focus:

### 🧠 Local LLM Ecosystem
- Running and managing local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio, GPT4All, LocalAI)  
- Working with quantized models (GGUF, GPTQ, AWQ)  
- Using OpenAI-compatible local APIs for multi-model environments  

### 🤖 Orchestration & Routing
- Intent-based routing  
- Semantic routing using embeddings  
- Model-aware + resource-optimized routing  
- Multi-step prompt chaining and modular workflows  

### 🧠 Memory & Context Management
- Summarization pipelines  
- Sliding context windows  
- RAG for long-term memory  
- Context compression strategies  

### ⚙️ Performance Optimization
- Managing KV cache, batching, paged attention  
- Hybrid CPU–GPU inference  
- Output + embedding caching  
- Using optimized engines (vLLM, llama.cpp)  

### 📊 Observability & Reliability
- Real-time CPU, RAM, and GPU monitoring (psutil, pynvml, GPUtil)  
- LLM tracing (Langfuse, Phoenix, Langsmith)  
- Quality metrics (accuracy, hallucination rate, perplexity)  
- Failover systems and fallback routing  

### 🔌 Tooling & API Integration
- Designing tool-call interfaces (similar to MCP)  
- API authentication (OAuth, API keys)  
- Parsing + executing commands safely  

---

## 🛠️ What I’m Building Right Now
- A local multi-LLM router that chooses the right model for each task  
- A terminal wrapper with real-time system monitoring  
- A prompt-orchestration engine with dynamic chains  
- A context manager that keeps conversations coherent over time  
- A fallback system for model failures or out-of-domain queries
